# TinyBus adapter

The adapter serves `ListTools` and `ExecuteTool` using the names and payloads
from `tinysearch-bus`. `tinybus_module::module_export!` accepts `SearchConfig`
at initialization and supports live reinitialization. The service owns provider
routing and does not log credentials, arguments, or results.

The built-in registry serves Parallel, TinyFish, Gemini grounded search, and
Gemini Deep Research. `ListTools` filters them by enabled state, route, and
credential availability on every initialization or reinitialization.
